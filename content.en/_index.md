## AlexELEC Project

For the most part, this is a set of solutions for easy setup and comfortable viewing of IPTV channels
in the <a target='_blank' href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi media center</a>. This includes:

+ **[TVLINK IPTV Server](/docs/tvlink/docs/overview/)** - IPTV channel repeater and aggregator
with a user-friendly web interface.
+ **TVLINK PVR Client** - add-on for Kodi that allows watching IPTV channels.
+ **TVLINK Simple Control** - add-on for Kodi that allows controlling some aspects of TVLINK's operation.
+ **<a target='_blank' href="https://libreelec.tv/">LibreELEC</a> / <a target='_blank' href="https://coreelec.org/">CoreELEC</a> (ae-fork)** - systems that are modified to work with TVLINK.
+ **Kodi for Android** - a modified version of Kodi (Android packages) with TVLINK support.
